# Workout Tracker

A workout tracker that enables the user to view create and track daily workouts. It allows the user to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It also enables the user to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. For example in a cardio exercise, the user will be able to track the distance they have traveled.
